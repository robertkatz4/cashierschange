#	Its the program most ppl start with when learning a language. Computes change. So like this: prompt the user for cost of item. Prompt user the amt of money. Should output the money to pay the person.
# 1. Cost of item? 6.25 2. How much are you giving the cashier? 10.00. 3. Return: "pay the person 3.75"
#	The 2nd part is to compute the proper bill breakdown.  Dont tell the cashier to give the person 375 pennies but 3 1 dollar bills and 3 quarters
#	Last part of the problem: account for "corner cases" like the item costs 6.25 and the user only gives cashier 5.75.

# DESIGNED TO BE RUN FROM THE COMMAND LINE
# I think it works OK. I only have a problem controlling decimal places -
# put 6.25 in as the cost of the item
# and 7.24 in as the amount given to the cashier and you see what I mean.
